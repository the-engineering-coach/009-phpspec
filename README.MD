# TDD vs. BDD: An Introduction to PHPSpec in PHP

This repository contains the code for The Engineering Coach YouTube video, "TDD vs. BDD: An Introduction to PHPSpec in PHP".

In this video, we explore PHPSpec, a framework that encourages Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). Unlike traditional TDD, BDD focuses on specifying the behaviour of your code before you implement it. This approach can lead to a more collaborative and clear development process.

## What You'll Learn

  - The core differences between TDD and BDD.
  - The fundamentals of writing specifications with PHPSpec.
  - How to use PHPSpec to drive the design of your code.
  - How PHPSpec integrates with your existing PHP workflow.
